# Riddles
I love riddles. I couldn't find a good enough collection across the internet, so I made one in my [Python RPG](github.com/crawsome/pyRPG_mini). Now, I'm offering this for free in hopes of it getting bigger and better. 

Please [Contribute to me](https://colinburke.com/contribute) if this helped you!

Thank you!

## Disclaimer:
* The dataset isn't perfect and needs pruning, and needs more riddles. Help me by submitting a pull request, or an issue!
* I didn't write these. These are from all around the internet. LMK if you find an unsavory or terrible riddles. 
* Please submit pull requests to add riddles. 

## TODO: Create a script that generates all files in repo:
* CSV
* Text
* sqlite3 database
* TBA (As requested)
* Some metadata for the riddles would be awesome. Riddle type. Answer Type. Difficulty rating. There's a lot of possibilities here. 

## What are Riddles? They're not Jokes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle

### Riddles are **Enigmas**
Problems in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking
* YES to Logic, to a degree. 
* YES Philosophy

### Riddles are also **Conduras**
Questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer
* YES Puns
* YES Wordplay
* YES Double-meanings

### Technicalities:
Technicalities go here. Weird off-case stuff. 
* No integers or symbols, make your answers in words only. One. Two. Three. Plus, Minus. 

### I remove these from the dataset: 
* One-liners / * Fun Facts / "Did you know" / Sexism / Cliche / Antihumor
* Shock / racism / cruel / sexual or alluding to sexual humor
* Super-easy childlike riddles that don't require any thought.
* Keep riddles short with single-word answers. Avoid plurals if possible. 
* Pop culture or trade jokes. 
* No English riddles with one-letter answers
