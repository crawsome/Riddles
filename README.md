# Riddles
I love riddles. I couldn't find a good enough collection across the internet, so I made one in my Python RPG. I'm offering it in this repo as a separate dataset. 
FORMAT:  Single-word-answers, short questions

### RIDDLE TYPES: 
* puns
* wordplay
* logic
* letters
* gutter humor

### NO: 
* Numbers
* adult humor
* anti-jokes
* stories
* heavy math
* domain-specific riddles ("Why did the 30 microfarad capacitor blow out, because he said he would never diode!?"

# Policy
