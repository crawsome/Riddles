# Riddles
I love riddles. I couldn't find a good enough collection across the internet, so I made one in my [Python RPG](github.com/crawsome/pyRPG_mini). 

## Disclaimer:
The dataset isn't perfect and needs pruning, and needs more riddles. I'm offering this for free in hopes of it getting bigger and better. 

### What are Riddles? They're not Jokes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle

#### Riddles are Enigmas
Problems in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking
* Logic
* Philosophy

#### Riddles are also Conduras
Questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer
* Puns
* Wordplay
* Double-meanings, 

### Technicalities:
Technicalities go here. Weird off-case stuff. 
* Make your answers in words only. One. Two. Three. Plus, Minus. 

### Riddles are NOT these: 
* If it's not in the "Question", "Answer" format, it's not allowed. 
* * No one-liners 
* * No fun Facts / Historical events
* * No Life-pro-tips
* No integers or symbols
* No Boomer humor / cliche / antihumor / cringe / racism
* * "I hate getting old LOL"
* * Why did the chicken cross the road?
* No long riddles
* I would argue against esoteric / domain knowledge jokes, they should belong in their own dataset IMHO. 
* * *"Why did the waterfall circult never blow out under load? Because he made preparations to diode!"*

# Policy
